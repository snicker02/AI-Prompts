Here's an update on a list of 63 prompt modifiers that I've categorized as 'Medium & technique'. You can use them in combination with a prompt. I've added | to all of these because many AI respond well to instructions that have been chopped up into smaller parts, e.g. "a metropolis at night | Dystopian".
Suggestions for more? Don't hesitate to post them!
Examples of all modifiers can be found in my posts (search for "medium").
